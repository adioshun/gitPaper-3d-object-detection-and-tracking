제안 : A robust representation of 3-D shapes learned with deep CNN

절차
1. 파노라마뷰로 변경 `Firstly, each 3-D shape is converted into a panoramic view`
2. 제안된 CNN을 통해 학습 `Then, a variant of CNN is specifically designed for learning the deep representations directly from such views. `

기존 CNN과 다른점은 **row-wise맥스 풀링층**을 추가 하여 invariant에 대처 하도록 함 `Different from typical CNN, a row-wise max-pooling layer is inserted between the convolution and fully-connected layers, making the learned representations invariant to the rotation around a principle axis`

## 1. INTRODUCTION

- Representation에 위해서 성능이 좌우됨 `The performance of many tasks, including shape classification and shape retrieval, heavily depend on the quality of the representation`

본 논문은 DeepPano을 제안,
- Directly learned from the panoramic views of 3-D models
- The panoramic view is a **cylinder projection** of a 3-D model around its principle axis.
- Therefore, the panoramic views are in the **form of 2-D images**,

Row-Wise Max-Pooling (RWMP) layer 제안
- To make the learned deep features invariant to the rotation around the principle axis
- between the convolution layers and the fully-connected layers.
- This layer takes the maximum value of each row in the convolutional feature maps.
- Consequently, the output feature vector is not affected by the shift of the panoramic view, caused by the rotation of 3-D shape.

### 1.1 관련 연구

기존 연구 동향 분류 : The previous methods on 3-D shape analysis can be coarsely categorized into **model-based** and **view-based** methods.

#### A. Model based methods
- Model based methods calculate a set of features directly from the 3-D shape **mesh** or its rendered **voxels**.

- 예 : Such methods include the Shape Histogram descriptor [2] and the Spin Images [3].

#### B. View based methods
- View based methods represent 3-D shapes by a set of views [4]–[10].

- The views can be 2-D projections of the shape or the panoramic view.


- 위 방법과 제안의 차이는 **hand-crafted**가 아니라 **CNN**을 이용한다. `However, different from most of the methods mentioned above that use hand-crafted features, we learn the representation from data with a variant of CNN. `


- 비슷한 기존 연구로 **3-D ShapeNets**가 있다. 이와 다른점은
- Different from [14] which performs 3-D convolutionson the **voxels**, we extract the representation of a 3-D shapefrom **2-D images**.
- 성능도 좋다. Compared with [14], our method achieves better performances on both classification and retrieval tasks(refer to Section III), and is simpler to implement using any open source framework.

### 1.2 기존 연구 PANORAMA와 rotates문제 해결법

Our method is related to previously introduced PANORAMA[6].

```

기존 연구도 **panoramic views**를 이용하였다. ` In [6], Panagiotis et al. proposed to represent a 3-D shape by the Discrete Fourier Transform and Discrete Wavelet Transform descriptors calculated from a set of panoramic views. `

Panoramoc view의 큰 문제점 : However,the panoramic view shifts when the 3-D shape rotates along its principle axis.

기존 연구에서는 **normalization**으로 해결 `In [6], this problem is alleviated by pose normalization.`

### 1.3 본 연구와 rotates문제 해결법

- (a) 3-D shapes of the same model, but rotated to different angles;
- (b) Convolutional feature map for each 3-D shape;
- (c) Output vectors of the RWMP layer;
- (d) Comparisons among within model distances, within class distances and between class distances
```

As illustrated in Fig. 1, the convolutional feature maps extracted from panoramic views shifts when the 3-D shape rotates.

We pool the the responses of each row so that the resulting representation is not affected by this kind of shift.

As a result, the representation is invariant to the 3-D shape rotation.

## 2. METHODOLOGY

Our method consists of two main steps:
1. Generate the panoramic views (Section II-A);
2. Learn and extract the rotation-invariant representation from the views (Section II-B).

본 논문의 가정(Assumption)사항 : 물체는 upright로 회전되어 있다. 대부분의 Datasets(3-D Warehouse)이 이렇게 되어 있다. ` Throughout this letter, we assume that 3-D models are upright oriented, so that the rotation is along a
axis that is also upright oriented. This assumption is satisfied in many real-world model repositories, such as the 3-D Warehouse[15].`


### 2.1 Panoramic View Construction

The projection process is illustrated in Fig. 2.

### 2.2 Representation Learning and Extraction

간단한 방법은 CNN에 파노라믹뷰를 학습 시키는 것이다. `A straightforward method is to train a CNN on the panoramic views of all training data, and extract the representation from it. `

#### A. 간단한 방법의 문제점
1. 하지만, 3D Shape가 **회전하면 View가 변하게 된다**. 이 변화를 막기 위하여 작업이 필요 하다. ` However, the view shifts when the 3-D shape rotates. This shift will greatly affect the representation produced by the CNN, although the CNN providessome form of translation invariance. `
2. 또한 파노라마로 펼치게 되면 **두개의 경계**가 양쪽끝에 나타난다. 이 경계가 CNN Featrue map에 영향을 미치게 된다. `Moreover, unfolding the lateral surface creates two boundaries on the left and right sides of the panoramic view. The boundaries cause artifacts in the convolutional feature maps, thus affecting the representation extracted.`


#### B. 해결방법

![](https://i.imgur.com/kJDdwhg.png)

```
[Fig. 3. The network for learning and extracting shape representation]
- The network takes the padded panoramic view as the input.
- On the top it outputs a probability vector representing class probabilities.
- The 3-D shape representation can be extracted from the highlighted layers, namely RWMP, fc1 or fc2.
```

###### 가. 경계

- 경계면에 **pad** 수행 : `To avoid boundary artifacts, the panoramic view is padded on one side. The padded area is cloned from the other side of the map. `
- Specifically, we adopt a padding size where is the height of the view.

###### 나. 회전에 대한 대응

- To obtain rotation-invariance, the representation has to be shift-invariant to the input panoramic view.

- **RWMP** 적용 : row-wise max-pooling layer(RWMP),
- which takes the maximum value of each row in the input map and concatenate them into the output vector.
- The output of the RWMP layer is not affected by the shift of th einput map, thus its output is invariant to the rotation of the 3-D shape.



학습 입력값 : The network is trained on a dataset consisting of **pairs of panoramic views** and class labels, using the back propagation algorithm [16].

학습 출력값 : Finally, the representation can be extracted from the RWMP layer, or any fully-connected layer after it.

### 2.3 Recognition with the Representation

- 출력값인 representation은 **classification**과 **retrieval tasks**에 모두 사용 가능 하다.

#### A. classification

- representation을 출력하는데 사용한 네트워크 자체가 분류기를 활용한것이므로 바로 분류 작업을 할수 있다. `Since the network for learning the representation is itself a classifier, we direct adopt it for classification tasks. `
- 결과물이 분류 확률값이다. `The softmax layer on the top of the network outputs class probabilities, and the class with the highest probability is taken as the prediction. `

#### B. retrieval

- Retrieval을 위하여 similarity(유사도)측정 방법을 제안 하였다.
- For retrieval tasks, we define the similarity between a pair of 3-D shapes as the Euclidean distance between their $$L_2$$ -normalized descriptors.

Since each 3-D shape is represented by a fixed-length vector and Euclidean distance is used for retrieval, we can perform fast retrieval on large-scale datasets, particularly when adopting some approximate nearest neighbor search schemes, e.g.[17].

## 3. EXPERIMENTS

## 4. CONCLUSION

Panoramic views are constructed from 3-D shapes and representations are learned and extracted from them.

제약 사항 `The limitation of our method is similar to many previous view-based approaches, `
- requiring the **principle axes of 3-D models**, which may fail to recognize the 3-D models with serious non-rigid deformation.

In the future, some sequence prediction techniques[21], [22] might be used for exploring more contextual information,

in order to further improve the performance of shape recognition, as a panoramic view can be considered as a map of feature sequence.

In addition, to establish the robust alignments/correspondence[23], [24] between different panoramic views is another direction that is worthy of being studied.

DeepPano [28] converts 3D shapes into panoramic views; i.e., a cylinder projection around its principle axis.

```


```
Recently, CNN architectures have been extended to allow for recognition from image sequences using a single network,
by unwrapping an object shape into a panorama and max pooling across each row [33-DeepPano].

단점 : However, both these methods assume that a fixed-length image sequence is provided during both training and testing, and hence are unsuitable for generalised multi-view recognition.

```



```
In [21], the authors suggest a new robust representation of 3D data by way of a cylindrical panoramic projection that is learned using a CNN.+

The authors tested their panoramic representation on ModelNet datasets and outperformed typical methods when they published their work.

Also, they presented a 3D descriptor (PANORAMA) [15] that captures the panoramic view of a 3D shape by projecting it to a lateral surface of a cylinder parallel to one of its three principal axes.
By aligning its principle axes to capture theg lobal information and combining 2D Discrete Fourier Transformand 2D Discrete Wavelet Transform, the PANORAMA outperforms all the other 3D shape retrieval methods on several standard 3D benchmarks.
