## 2. Background

### 2.1 System Model


#### 2.1.1 Target Dynamics


비행기 같은 physical systems의 dynamics는 **state-space model**로 모델링 가능 하다. `The dynamics of physical systems such as airplanes, vessels, ballistic targets, etc., can be modeled using a state-space model [14][18][93]. `

With state-space modeling, a moving target can be represented as the transition in the state of a target driven by a process noise.

##### A. nonlinear model



##### B. linear time invariant system
